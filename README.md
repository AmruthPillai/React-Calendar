# Building a Calendar from Scratch in React

### [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyVFo2X5IM8) | [Live Demo](https://react-calendar-nu.vercel.app/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/React-Calendar)

Just got a great coding walkthrough/tutorial idea and just had to get working on it immediately. Hope you folks enjoy the presentation!

In this video, we're going to be building a Calendar from scratch using React + Typescript.

I've made use of Vite for frontend tooling, React + Typescript as my framework of choice, TailwindCSS for styling and to help out with some date math, the amazing date-fns library.
